#Pindel2BAM
Convert [Pindel](https://github.com/ding-lab/pindel2) output into SAM format.

This is a hack on top of original
[Pindel2BAM](https://github.com/ding-lab/pindel2). Its purpose is to preserve
(or fill in) a few SAM tags required by BAM viewers and other tools. Currently
it does two things that the upstream tool does not do:

* preserves read orientation in flags
* uses sample name to fill the RG tag

The missing MD tag can be filled externally with

    samtools fillmd

Althow this repo has 'BAM' in its name, the tool does not make BAMs. It generates SAM files.

Original README follows.

##Compiling
To convert from Pindel to SAM, first compile pindel2sam.cpp with the
provided Make file. Pindel2BAM can compile with gcc version 4.4.3.

##Usage
Pindel2BAM takes four inputs in the following order:
* Pindel data directory
* desired output directory
* Pindel config file that was used to generate the Pindel data
* Genome reference index file (fa.fai) used to generate the Pindel data

Only the deletion and short insertion data are used (_D & _SI),
and all Pindel data files within the Pindel data directory provided
will be read, converted, and compiled initially into SAM files
(same file names as in the config file with the .sam file extension
appended). The SAM files are written into the desired output
directory and converted to BAM files. Finally, the BAM files are sorted
and indexed using the following samtools commands.

samtools view -bS convertedfilename.sam > bamfilename.bam
samtools sort bamfilename.bam sortedbamfilename.bam
samtools index sortedbamfilename.bam

The sorted files can then be used in a genome viewer such as IGV as normal.


##NOTES
Pindel2BAM assumes that you have at least [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) version 1.5.
Currently, filler data exists for the following SAM fields:
* FLAG = 2
* MAPQ = *
* RNEXT = *
* PNEXT = 0
* TLEN = 0
* QUAL = *

If the converter pin2sam has not been compiled, then Pindel2BAM will
compile it automatically.

If your bam file names listed in the config file have a directory prefix,
then the / will be turned into _ for the output file names.

If output files already exist, Pindel2SAM will append any data
within the _D and _SI files to the existing output .sam files.
You must therefore clean out the output directory before running
if you want fresh conversions.
